<p>SO! What you will be wanting to do is of course get your instrument with valves (Tuba, Trumpet)
and then get the valve oil ( Look at the first picture). Then you would want to remember if you bought this anywhere except for the link I gave you (go to the links
page). If you are reading this for the first time go to the link page and order some blue juice valve oil. If you already have the valve oil and you are just wondering
how to oil your trumpet in the first place I will tell you in a little bit. If you just ordered some go to the next section</p>
<h1>All you have to do now is WAIT</h1>
<p>So yeah all you will be wanting to do is wait for the package to arrive which might take a while so.... yeah.... go do whatever you do and when it arrives 
come back here!!</p>


<h1>How to oil your trumpet Valves (continued)</h1>
<p>So if you already have your valve oil you would want to get your instrument with VALVE these only work with valved instruments!!! So you would want to pull out 
one of the valves and how you would do that is twist the cap or the thing that is twistable and twist it untill pops up but DO NOT pull it out all the way
and my friend is telling me right now (09/28/18) that what if they dont like reading you should put a video. But to be honest if you wanted to watch a video
on how to oil your valves you should have gone to YouTube (copyright)!! So any way what you do when you DONT pull out your valve all the way, you would want to 
go to a spot without a hole beneath it then put a small drop of valve oil on each side. So when you put it back in the SHOULD be a numer at the top of the valve 
once you find that number you would face that number toward the mouthpeice. Then after you put it in and screw the cap back on push on the valve 5-10 times and 
do this with all the other valves and do this everyday</p>



<h1>I hope you <strong>enjoyed</strong> my website of facts</h1>
<p>BTW I made this whole website from scratch so if you want to make something like thi I reccomend <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp">this website</a> if you want to learn
how to code like this because unless you come easy to this (because I didnt) you should really go there and also download this thing called Code Pa/> (copyright) or 
just type in code pad to get it and for starters you go to new and then click HTML5 and just look at the site I reccomended and you will be good for the plain page
but if you want the page to not just be black words and a white page backround you might want to add a CSS 3 in the "new" page go back to the page that I reccomended
and you might be able to make something like this page well see ya untill next time! BYE!!</p>
