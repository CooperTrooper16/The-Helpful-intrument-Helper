<p>Hello and I hope you guys had a really good thankgiving! I was in social studies and I saw that Canada has less overwight people than 
America...maybe it is because of us going overboard on Thanksgiving. I do hope you have a very merry Christmas!! I also wanted to say whoever doesn't care about Stan Lee dieing is a absolute monster. Anyway

<h2><b>How to grease your trombone slide or any slide!!!</b></h2>

<img src="slidegrease.png" alt="oil" class="right" height="150" width="150">
<p>The first thing you want to do before you even get the slide grease out. 
Get out a clean cloth (should be included in trombone case). After you get a cloth 
take the slide out of the trombone and clean it with the cloth you grabbed earlier.
So after you cleaned the slide what you would want to do is... wait for me to put in the next section because I am just saying that the people who had to go to the 
links page an go get some slide grease I am just telling all of those people that I am waiting </p>
<h1>All you have to do now is WAIT</h1>
<p>So yeah all you will be wanting to do is wait for the package to arrive which might take a while so.... yeah.... go do whatever you do and when it arrives 
come back here!!</p>


<h1>For the people who have gotten the package or are ready on how to oil your slide.</h1>
    
<p>What you will need to do is get the slide oil that you either ordered or already had. After you get it or if you had it with you all of this time
you will need to open the slide oil. After you open it get some on your fingers unless you have a shapstick looking thing that has slide oil in it 
then you will want to skip a little. So if you have the type of thing that you can get slide grease on your fingers get them on your fingers. After 
you have to put it on the tips of the metal part of the slide. After you do that you will have to put in the slide one metal rod/pole in one at 
a time. After you do that you should pull the slide in and out to make sure that the grease gets on all of the slide. That is how to grease your 
slide. </p>



<h1>I hope you <strong>enjoyed</strong> my website of facts</h1>
<p>BTW I made this whole website from scratch so if you want to make something like this I reccomend <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp">this website</a> if you want to learn
how to code like this because unless you come easy to this (because I didnt) you should really go there and also download this thing called Code Pa/> (copyright) or 
just type in code pad to get it and for starters you go to new and then click HTML5 and just look at the site I reccomended and you will be good for the plain page
but if you want the page to not just be black words and a white page backround you might want to add a CSS 3 in the "new" page go back to the page that I reccomended
and you might be able to make something like this page well see ya untill next time! BYE!!</p>
