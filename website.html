<h1>Happy kinda not almost Thanksgiving!!!<h1> 
<p>Hope you all are enjoyed halloween! I hope you guys and girls 
got alot of candy! I got a whole lot of candy because I went to 2 neighboorhoods! I hope y'all had a good october but it 
is now the month of turkey. Also with a new month comes a new topic! The next topic is that I am going to be talking about 
how to grease your slide! A slide would be on a trombone! So if you play a trombone and don't know how to grease your slide listen to this. (Read this you 
litterally can't "listen" to this)</p>
 



<h2><b>How to grease your trombone slide or any slide!!!</b></h2>

<img src="slidegrease.png" alt="oil" class="right" height="150" width="150">
<p>The first thing you want to do before you even get the slide grease out. 
Get out a clean cloth (should be included in trombone case). After you get a cloth 
take the slide out of the trombone and clean it with the cloth you grabbed earlier.
So after you cleaned the slide what you would want to do is... wait for me to put in the next section because I am just saying that the people who had to go to the 
links page an go get some slide grease I am just telling all of those people that I am waiting </p>
<h1>All you have to do now is WAIT</h1>
<p>So yeah all you will be wanting to do is wait for the package to arrive which might take a while so.... yeah.... go do whatever you do and when it arrives 
come back here!!</p>


<h1>For the people who have gotten the package or are ready on how to oil your slide.</h1>

<h1>I hope you <strong>enjoyed</strong> my website of facts</h1>
<p>BTW I made this whole website from scratch so if you want to make something like this I reccomend <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp">this website</a> if you want to learn
how to code like this because unless you come easy to this (because I didnt) you should really go there and also download this thing called Code Pa/> (copyright) or 
just type in code pad to get it and for starters you go to new and then click HTML5 and just look at the site I reccomended and you will be good for the plain page
but if you want the page to not just be black words and a white page backround you might want to add a CSS 3 in the "new" page go back to the page that I reccomended
and you might be able to make something like this page well see ya untill next time! BYE!!</p>
